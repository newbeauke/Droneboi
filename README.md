This is a public repository for the Droneboi game by Rizen Planet Studios, released in 2020.

This project will likely not work as is if you try to open it in Unity directly, since I had to remove some sensitive assets before making it public. However, it can certainly be made to work again with some adjustments or be used as a reference for your own work.

The [Droneboi server](https://github.com/newbeauke/DroneboiServer) is also available.
